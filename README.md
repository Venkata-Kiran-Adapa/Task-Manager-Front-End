## Features
1. ***User Authentication***
- **Login:** Users can log in using a unique username and PIN. If the entered credentials match an existing account, the user will be granted access to their task management page.
- **Welcome Message:** Upon successful login, a personalized welcome message is displayed, showing the userâ€™s name and a prompt to view their tasks.

2.***Task Management***:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add tasks by entering.
  - *Task Name*: A brief description of the task (e.g., "Complete Assignment").
   - *Task Description*: Detailed information about the task (e.g., "Complete the math assignment before the deadline").
   - *Due Date*: The target date for completing the task (e.g., "30/12/2024").
- **Task Types**: After adding tasks, users can view them under the selected categories. Tasks are dynamically filtered based on the selected category.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks after they are marked as completed or no longer needed.

3.**Categorize Tasks**:
- Tasks can be categorized into Personal, Home, Office, and College categories.

4.**Responsiveness**:

5.**Persistence**:
- Tasks are saved in localStorage, so data persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
## Technologies Used
- TypeScript for type-safe and structured code.
- Bootstrap for responsive design and UI components.
- HTML and CSS for frontend styling and layout.
- DOM Manipulation for dynamic content and task management.
- Webpack: For module bundling, optimizing assets, and simplifying the development workflow.


## How It Works
**Login:**  Users log in using their username and PIN. Successful authentication displays a welcome message and access to their tasks.

## Webpack Configuration
Webpack is used to bundle the TypeScript files. The webpack.config.js file handles the following:

- **Entry:** Specifies the entry point (app.ts) for the application.
- **Output:** Bundles the TypeScript files into a single JavaScript file (app.js).
- **Loaders:** Uses ts-loader to transpile TypeScript files into JavaScript.
- **DevServer:** Configures Webpack's development server to serve the app.
- **Source Maps:** Enables inline source maps for easier debugging
